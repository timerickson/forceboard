Yes, there are several libraries for force-directed graphs that are better than D3. Here are some of them:

- **Arbor.js**: A graph visualization library using web workers and jQuery⁸.
- **Cytoscape.js**: A fully featured graph theory library that includes many layout algorithms⁹.
- **EulerForce**: A force-directed graph layout algorithm that uses Euler's method⁷.
- **ForceGraph**: A library for rendering force-directed graphs on the HTML5 canvas⁶.
- **Gephi**: An open-source network analysis and visualization software package⁸.
- **Graphviz**: A graph visualization software package that allows you to create diagrams of graphs and networks⁸.
- **Sigma.js**: A lightweight JavaScript library for drawing graphs using HTML5 canvas[^10^].

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
